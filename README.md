## Overview
This project leverages the Flower Framework for steering angle classification. The Flower Framework is a powerful tool for developing and fine-tuning machine learning models to predict steering angles in autonomous vehicles. Whether you are building a self-driving car or working on a related research project, this framework provides the foundation you need.

## Features
- Flower framework for federated learning.
- Steering angle prediction for autonomous vehicles.
- Efficient model training and evaluation.

## Data
The [Steering angle classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/roydatascience/training-car) was obtained from Kaggle. The dataset comprises 24K images and their corresponding steering angle. 


## Training 
The training process followed a federated approach, wherein the dataset was partitioned into two separate clients. Within each client, a local model was trained, and the resulting local weights were transmitted to the server via the gRPC communication framework. At the server, the local weights were aggregated using the federated average algorithm to obtain global weights, which were then distributed back to the clients. This approach allowed the training data to stay on the clients while enabling a distributed model training process with a federated approach.


## Evaluation

The data was partitioned into training, testing, and validation datasets. The evaluation of the trained model occurred at both the clients and the server using the following steps:

1. Prior to sending their local weights, each client performed its own model evaluation.
2. On the server side, all the local weights were aggregated, and the model was evaluated using the server's local data.
3. The resulting global weights were sent back to the clients, and the evaluation process was repeated using these new global weights.
